## Meet The Team

### <u><b>Colin Pereira</b></u> | <u>Project Head</u>
Hello, I'm Colin Pereira, and I'm the single team member of this project. With this project, the aim is to develop my skills in Full-Stack development, in addition to my Web-Dev skills overall. While this could have been a group project, I decided to take it on alone since I am confident in my skills and due to my personal schedule.

## Project Choice
<b>Grocery Price Tracker</b>

<hr>

## Project Statement
To build a web-based program that will allow general users to check the prices of grocery items at various locations in real time, and allow users with permissions to set alerts, comment and see historical prices of items.

## Project Description
My mission in developing the Grocery Price Tracker will be to allow all users to track the prices of items at various locations and view general price trends in real time. Additionally, users that are registered and logged in will be able to see historical prices and comment on items. Website admins will be able to search for users, enable/disable users, remove comments, add/remove/edit items and locations, all through an admin portal within the site. Finally, the site should be designed using the responsive design philosophy to ensure that users of all kinds will be able to access the site effectively on any device.
